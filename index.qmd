My name is Collin Gates and I am Majoring in Business. I am learing about Data Analytics. In my free time I like to research and invest in cryptocurrencies and find using and learning about new AI technology interesting. I don't use many social media applications, however, I do utilize twitter, telegram, and discord a lot throughout the day to keep up to date with all things crypto.
