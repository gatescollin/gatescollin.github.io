I'm Collin Gates, currently pursuing a major in Business with a new found appreciation for Data Analytics. Outside of my academic pursuits. I have had a passion for the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies since 2017, where I actively engage in research and investment. I have a growing fascination with the evolving landscape of AI technology, finding its advancements extremely intriguing. While I'm not heavily active on most social media platforms, I frequently use Twitter, Telegram, and Discord to stay informed and connected with the latest trends in the crypto sphere
